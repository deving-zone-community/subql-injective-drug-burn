  # This endpoint must be a public non-pruned archive node
  # We recommend providing more than one endpoint for improved reliability, performance, and uptime
  # Public nodes may be rate limited, which can affect indexing speed
  # When developing your project we suggest getting a private API key
  # You can get them from OnFinality for free https://app.onfinality.io

  endpoint:
#    - "https://sentry.tm.injective.network"
    - "https://injective-rpc.publicnode.com"
  # Optionally provide the HTTP endpoint of a full chain dictionary to speed up processing
